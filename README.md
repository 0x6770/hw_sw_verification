# Objectives

- GPIO

  1. Modify the GPIO RTL to add parity generation/checking
  2. Create unit-level constrained random testbench written in SystemVerilog for GPIO peripheral
  3. Write appropriate SystemVerilog assertions
     - To cover designer intent
     - To describe behaviour of the interfaces
  4. Attempt to prove some properties using Formal verification
  5. Develop checkers for the GPIO peripheral behaviour
  6. Write functional coverage and demonstrate coverage has been achieved
  7. Demonstrate integration and verification at the Cortex-M0 SOC level

- VGA

  1. Instantiate a redundant VGA peripheral block plus add RTL for a comparator
  2. Create unit-level constrained random testbench written in SystemVerilog for VGA peripheral
  3. Write appropriate SystemVerilog assertions
     - To cover designer intent
     - To describe behaviour of the interfaces
  4. Attempt to prove some properties using Formal verification
  5. Develop checkers for the VGA peripheral behaviour
  6. Write functional coverage and demonstrate coverage has been achieved
  7. Demonstrate integration and verification at the Cortex-M0 SOC level
